# Public-School-Facility-Location-and-Capacity-planning-Optimization-Model
This model determines the optimal number of schools required and the capacity of each school within a specific district in northern India. It uses a transportation model to assign students from the district to schools in a way that minimizes travel time while also optimizing school capacity. To address the complexity of this NP-hard problem, Benders decomposition was implemented. The model was divided into two parts: the master problem, which determines the number and location of school facilities, and the subproblem, which solves the transportation assignment for students to these schools.
